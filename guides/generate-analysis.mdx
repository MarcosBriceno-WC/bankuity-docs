title: Generate Analysis Report
---

The Bankuity Income Analysis service provides a RESTful interface for performing financial evaluations. The API goes beyond simple data retrieval to identify and verify income sources, evaluate stability, and derive real-time risk scores from bank statement data.

This tutorial guides you through the process of requesting Bankuity to fetch raw data from your Instant Bank Verification (IBV) provider, calculate complex financial patterns, and return a production-ready analysis report.

## Pre-requisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- A valid `requestCode` from your integrated IBV provider.
- Your API credentials (`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` and `Authorization key`) securely stored on your backend.

## Execute the Analysis Request

To initiate and retrieve an analysis you need to send a **GET** request to the `/v2/analysis/income` endpoint, sending the `requestCode` and `ProviderName` of your IBV provider as query parameters.

See an example request in the code block below:

```cURL
curl --ssl-no-revoke \
  --location --request GET \
  "https://apisbx.bankuity.com/incomeanalyzer-apiv2/v2/analysis/income?requestCode=XXX&ibvProviderName=Chirp" \
  -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: {YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}" \
  -H "Authorization: {YOUR_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
See the query parameters table below for more details.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `requestCode` | `string` | Your provider-specific identifier for this specific client request. |
| `ibvProviderName` | `string` | The name of the integrated IBV provider from which data should be sourced. |

The endpoint checks the `requestCode` with the IBV provider. If new data is available, a new snapshot is analyzed, otherwise, stored results are returned.

### Response

Upon a successful 200 OK response, you will receive a `GetProcessingResultsResponse` object.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `requestId` | `string` | This is a unique, Bankuity-generated identifier for this specific analysis instance. |

You must store the `requestId` to access the analysis results later via the `/v2/analysis/income/result` endpoint without re-triggering provider data fetching. The response includes detailed account info, active monthly income, risk scores, and suggested loan amounts.
